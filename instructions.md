# Instructions of the project:

This project should include, at minimum, HTML files related to:

- the blog website - OK
- an example blog post - OK
- as well as any related CSS files for styling - OK

Things to include:

## Blog overview page:

- contains a title, list of blog posts, search (?), subscribe link (?), footer - OK
- each blog post tile should contain: type, title, date and a link - OK

## Blog details page:

- title, date, many paragraphs (with headers and sub-headers) - OK
- side bar which contains: about, archive (list of links), elsewhere (some links to other sites) - OK
- include at least one image, and that this image is accompanied by a caption - OK
- footer + social links - OK

## Project structure:

- You'll want separate HTML files, and related CSS files, for each piece of the website: the main page, a blog post. Note that these should not all fall in the parent directory, but should also be organized into subdirectories. - OK
- Draw out some mock pages of the website - OK
- HTML -> follow: https://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/index.html as a guide
- You should have a primary CSS file that is linked to from each of the HTML pages, then import separate CSS files(opens in a new tab) for each page into this primary CSS file. Be sure to take a look at the: https://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/css.html . Note that you need to use both Flexbox and Grid per the project rubric(opens in a new tab) as part of your CSS.
- Link between pages. If your project structure is set up correctly and you add the appropriate links within your HTML, a user should be able to click on those links to go between the main page, an example blog post, and the (optional) design system without issue. Note that it is fine to have certain links, like "Subscribe", be fake links.
- Think about deploying it to Github pages
- Use git guide: https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/
